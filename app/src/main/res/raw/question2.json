Cloud service providers invest in hardware resources and then release those resources (often on a per-hour basis) to subscribers. One of the problems with this business model, however, is that at any given time, there are likely to be compute resources that are not being utilized. These resources represent hardware capacity that AWS has paid for but are sitting idle, and not making AWS any money at the moment. Rather than allowing these computing resources to go to waste, AWS offers them at a substantially discounted rate, with the understanding that if someone needs those resources for running a normal EC2 instance, that instance will take priority over spot instances that are using the hardware resources at a discounted rate. In fact, spot instances will be stopped if the resources are needed elsewhere.https://awsinsider.net/articles/2017/09/25/aws-spot-instances-primer.aspx  理解 Spot 实例的关键是看Amazon 网络服务（AWS）等云服务提供商的运作方式.云服务提供商投资于硬件资源，然后将这些资源（通常以每小时为单位）释放给订阅者.然而，这种商业模式的问题之一是，在任何给定时间，都可能存在未被利用的计算资源.这些资源代表 AWS 已支付但处于闲置状态的硬件容量，目前还没有为 AWS 带来任何收益. AWS 不会让这些计算资源浪费，而是以大幅折扣价提供它们，并理解如果有人需要这些资源来运行正常的 EC2 实例，该实例将优先于使用硬件资源的现货实例以折扣价.事实上，如果其他地方需要资源，Spot 实例将停止. https://awsinsider.net/articles/2017/09/25/aws-spot-instances-primer.aspx",

Each AZ runs on its own physically distinct, independent infrastructure, and is engineered to be highly reliable. In case of an infrastructure failure, Amazon RDS performs an automatic failover to the standby (or to a read replica in the case of Amazon Aurora), so that you can resume database operations as soon as the failover is complete. Since the endpoint for your DB Instance remains the same after a failover, your application can resume database operation without the need for manual administrative intervention.https://aws.amazon.com/rds/details/multi-az/  Amazon RDS 多可用区部署为数据库 (DB) 实例提供增强的可用性和持久性，使其自然适合生产数据库工作负载.当您预置多可用区数据库实例时，Amazon RDS 会自动创建一个主数据库实例并将数据同步复制到不同可用区 (AZ) 中的备用实例.每个 AZ 都在其自己的物理上不同的独立基础架构上运行，并且设计为高度可靠.如果基础设施发生故障，Amazon RDS 会自动故障转移到备用数据库（或 Amazon Aurora 的只读副本），以便您可以在故障转移完成后立即恢复数据库操作.由于您的数据库实例的端点在故障转移后保持不变，因此您的应用程序可以恢复数据库操作而无需手动管理干预.https://aws.amazon.com/rds/details/multi-az/",

For companies that have managed their own data centers or server rooms for decades, there are a few steps to consider--and it's not always wise to pull the plug on an internal infrastructure quite so quickly. If a startup uses on-premise business servers and then experiences unexpected growth, abandoning those servers doesn't make sense (even if the long-term plan is to do exactly that). AWS Storage Gateway is a way to bridge this gap for companies of any size. It's a hybrid storage option that connects on-premise storage including age-old tape backup systems to the cloud in a way that also provides one console to access all storage configurations.https://www.techradar.com/news/what-is-aws-storage-gateway  将数据移动到云端并不像拨动开关那么简单.对于几十年来管理自己的数据中心或服务器机房的公司，有几个步骤需要考虑——而且这么快拔掉内部基础设施的插头并不总是明智的.如果一家初创公司使用本地业务服务器，然后经历了意外的增长，那么放弃这些服务器是没有意义的（即使长期计划就是这样做）. AWS Storage Gateway 是为任何规模的公司弥合这一差距的一种方式.这是一种混合存储选项，可将包括古老磁带备份系统在内的本地存储连接到云，同时还提供一个控制台来访问所有存储配置.https://www.techradar.com/news/what-is -aws-存储网关",
